This project is a simple website just to handle some web API's. I was creating a dataset for our Deep-Learning model for image segmentation. the platform i've chosen was "Supervisely".
I needed a way to make uploading data into supervisely easier for my team, so build this website.
the structure of folders should be like this ~/images/directories/*.png

the URL of the website: http://img.raham.space
